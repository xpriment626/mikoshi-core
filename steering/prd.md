# Mikoshi - Product Requirements Document
*The Postman for Multi-Agent Communication*

## Executive Summary

Mikoshi is a no-code testing and validation platform for multi-agent AI systems. It enables product teams, QA engineers, and compliance officers to verify that their AI agents communicate correctly, handle failures gracefully, and maintain business invariants - all without writing code.

### The Problem
Organizations deploying multi-agent AI systems face critical risks:
- **Unpredictable failures** when agents miscommunicate or messages arrive out of order
- **Compliance violations** from PII leakage or unauthorized actions
- **Lack of visibility** into how agent teams actually behave under stress
- **Developer bottleneck** - only engineers can test agent communications

Current solutions require deep technical expertise and custom code for every test scenario.

### Our Solution
A visual testing platform that lets anyone upload agent conversations, define business rules in plain English, simulate real-world failures, and get clear pass/fail results with actionable insights.

### Key Outcomes
- **Reduce agent-related incidents by 75%** through proactive chaos testing
- **Cut testing time from days to minutes** with no-code interface
- **Enable compliance teams** to directly verify AI behavior
- **Accelerate deployment confidence** with quantified resilience scores

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: First-Time QA Test

**Sarah (QA Engineer)** receives a new customer service agent system to test:

1. **Uploads** conversation log from staging environment
2. **Selects** pre-built rules: "No double charging" and "PII protection"
3. **Enables** 20% message loss chaos
4. **Runs** test suite (10 variations)
5. **Discovers** system charges twice when messages arrive out of order
6. **Shares** report with development team
7. **Re-tests** after fix to confirm resolution

**Time**: 15 minutes (vs. 2 days writing custom tests)

### Journey 2: Compliance Verification

**Jennifer (Compliance)** needs to verify GDPR compliance:

1. **Accesses** Mikoshi (no code setup required)
2. **Uploads** production conversation samples
3. **Applies** "GDPR Compliance Pack" rules
4. **Runs** comprehensive test suite
5. **Downloads** compliance report with evidence
6. **Submits** to auditors

**Outcome**: Direct compliance validation without engineering dependency

### Journey 3: Production Debugging

**Alex (Developer)** investigating customer complaint:

1. **Exports** conversation from production logs
2. **Uploads** to Mikoshi
3. **Sees** visual timeline with violation highlighted
4. **Identifies** race condition in message ordering
5. **Fixes** issue and adds regression test
6. **Integrates** test into CI/CD pipeline

**Result**: Root cause identified in minutes, not hours
